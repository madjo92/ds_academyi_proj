# <h2 align="center">Exploratory Data Analysis and data scraping for the Academy Award winners and nominees for Best International Feature Film</h2>

## Code and Resources Used:
* **Python Version:** 3.8
* **Jupiter Notebook:** 6.3
* **Web Scraping:** https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq6XkhO5SZ66N04IcPbqNcw , http://www.omdbapi.com/
* **Packages:**  BeautifulSoup, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, json, pickle

## Web Scraping
**I am scraping data from wikipedia page using BeautifulSoup library, also I am using omdbapi.com for scraping some missing data.**
* title

* 'Cinematography',
* 'Edited by',
* 'Music by',
* 'Distributed by',

## Data Cleaning
After scraping the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for eda. I made the following changes and created the following variables:
* Convert running time into an integer
* Clean up references [1]
* Convert dates into datetime object
* Split up the long strings
* Removing unnecessary columns for eda 
* Adding necessary columns for eda('month', 'year', 'rotten_tomatoes_norm', 'metascore_norm', 'won', 'sum_of_awards')
* Adding running time values to the movies that we were missing data
* Adding won values for the movies that we were missing data

## EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
*  Normalizing imdb, metascore, rotten_tomatoes columns to have RATINGS 0-10(imdb stays the same)
*  Top 10 winners, top 10 winners and nominees acording to IMDB
*  Combining IMDB and Rotten tomatoes top 10 score
*  Creating a scatterplot exploring the relationship between IMDB ratings and RT ratings.
*  Top 10 longest and shortest movies that won Academy Award for Best International Feature Film
*  Top 10 most successful films acording to awards and nominations they recieved
*  Creating a plot to compare Winners and nominees through the months
*  Creating countplot to visualize most common genres or combinations of genres in the dataset
*  How successful were the movies who won an Oscar comparing to the ones who didn't? Measuring the awards and nominations they recieved.
*  Plot for  Academy Awards and nominations for Best International Feature Film  by country
